            Welcome to the Vernet Lab

            <p>Our research focuses on consciousness from a neuroscience point of view. 
            What are the brain mechanisms allowing us to consciously perceive information in the external world? 
            How spontaneous brain activity can give rise to the consciousness of our thoughts, of our own actions?
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">To explore these questions, we use a combination of methods including psychophysics, eye movements tracking,
            transcranial magnetic stimulation, functional magnetic resonance imaging, 
            electro- and magnetoencephalography.
