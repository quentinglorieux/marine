            "publication_abstract": "<p>Many questions in cell biology and biophysics involve the quantitation of co-localisation and the interaction of proteins tagged with different fluorophores. however, the incomplete separation of the different colour channels due to the presence of autofluorescence, along with cross-excitation and emission \"bleed-through\" of one colour channel into the other, all combine to render the interpretation of multi-band images ambiguous. here we introduce a new live-cell epifluorescence spectral imaging and linear unmixing technique for classifying resolution-limited point objects containing multiple fluorophores. we demonstrate the performance of our technique by detecting, at the single-vesicle level, the co-expression of the vesicle-associated membrane protein, vamp-2 (also called synaptobrevin-2), linked to either enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) or citrine [a less ph-sensitive variant of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eyfp)], in mouse cortical astrocytes. in contrast, the co-expression of vamp-2-citrine and the lysosomal transporter sialine fused to egfp resulted in little overlap. spectral imaging and linear unmixing permit us to fingerprint the expression of spectrally overlapping fluorescent proteins on single secretory organelles in the presence of a spectrally broad autofluorescence. our technique provides a robust alternative to error-prone dual- or triple colour co-localisation studies.</p>\n",

(2005) reported prolongation of saccade latency of prosaccades in dementia with lewy body (dlb). the goal of this study is to go further examining all parameters, such as rates of express latency, but also accuracy and velocity of saccades, and their variability.methods: we examined horizontal and vertical saccades in 10 healthy elderly subjects and 10 patients with dlb. two tasks were used: the gap (fixation target extinguishes prior to target onset) and the overlap (fixation stays on after target onset). eye movements were recorded with the eyelink ii eye tracker.results: the main findings were: (1) as for healthy, latencies were shorter in the gap than in the overlap task (a gap effect); (2) for both tasks latency of saccades was longer for dlb patients and for all directions; (3) express latency in the gap task was absent for large majority of dlb patients while such saccades occurred frequency for controls; (4) accuracy and peak velocity were lower in dlb patients; (5) variability of all parameters was abnormally high in dlb patients.conclusions: abnormalities of all parameters, latency, accuracy and peak velocity reflect spread deficits in cortical-subcortical circuits involved in the triggering and execution of saccades.</p>\n",

            "publication_abstract": "<p>Aging is associated with changes in the motor system that, over time, can lead to functional impairments and contribute negatively to the ability to recover after brain damage. unfortunately, there are still many questions surrounding the physiological mechanisms underlying these impairments. we examined cortico-spinal excitability and plasticity in a young cohort (age range: 19-31) and an elderly cohort (age range: 47-73) of healthy right-handed individuals using navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (ntms). subjects were evaluated with a combination of physiological [motor evoked potentials (meps), motor threshold (mt), intracortical inhibition (ici), intracortical facilitation (icf), and silent period (sp)] and behavioral [reaction time (rt), pinch force, 9 hole peg task (hpt)] measures at baseline and following one session of low-frequency (1 hz) navigated repetitive tms (rtms) to the right (non-dominant) hemisphere. in the young cohort, the inhibitory effect of 1 hz rtms was significantly in the right hemisphere and a significant facilitatory effect was noted in the unstimulated hemisphere. conversely, in the elderly cohort, we report only a trend toward a facilitatory effect in the unstimulated hemisphere, suggesting reduced cortical plasticity and interhemispheric communication. to this effect, we show that significant differences in hemispheric cortico-spinal excitability were present in the elderly cohort at baseline, with significantly reduced cortico-spinal excitability in the right hemisphere as compared to the left hemisphere. a correlation analysis revealed no significant relationship between cortical thickness of the selected region of interest (roi) and meps in either young or old subjects prior to and following rtms. when combined with our preliminary results, further research into this topic could lead to the development of neurophysiological markers pertinent to the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of neurological diseases characterized by monohemispheric damage and lateralized motor deficits.</p>\n",

            "publication_abstract": "<p>Background: frequent oulomotricity problems with orthoptic testing were reported in patients with tinnitus. this study examines with objective recordings vergence eye movements in patients with somatic tinnitus patients with ability to modify their subjective tinnitus percept by various movements, such as jaw, neck, eye movements or skin pressure.methods: vergence eye movements were recorded with the eyelink ii video system in 15 (23-63 years) control adults and 19 (36-62 years) subjects with somatic tinnitus.findings: 1) accuracy of divergence but not of convergence was lower in subjects with somatic tinnitus than in control subjects. 2) vergence duration was longer and peak velocity was lower in subjects with somatic tinnitus than in control subjects. 3) the number of embedded saccades and the amplitude of saccades coinciding with the peak velocity of vergence were higher for tinnitus subjects. yet, saccades did not increase peak velocity of vergence for tinnitus subjects, but they did so for controls. 4) in contrast, there was no significant difference of vergence latency between these two groups.interpretation: the results suggest dysfunction of vergence areas involving cortical-brainstem-cerebellar circuits. we hypothesize that central auditory dysfunction related to tinnitus percept could trigger mild cerebellar-brainstem dysfunction or that tinnitus and vergence dysfunction could both be manifestations of mild cortical-brainstem-cerebellar syndrome reflecting abnormal cross-modality interactions between vergence eye movements and auditory signals.</p>\n",

            "publication_abstract": "<p>Triggering of saccades depends on the task: in the gap task, fixation point switches off and target appears after a gap period; in the overlap task, target appears while fixation point is still on. saccade latencies are shorter in the gap task, due to fixation disengagement and advanced movement preparation during the gap. the two modes of initiation are also hypothesized to be subtended by different cortical-subcortical circuits. this study tested whether interleaving the two tasks modifies latencies, due to switching between different modes of triggering. two groups of healthy participants (21-29 vs. 39-55 years) made horizontal and vertical saccades in gap, overlap, and mixed tasks; saccades were recorded with the eyelink. both groups showed shorter latencies in the gap task, i.e. a robust gap effect and systematic differences between directions. for young adults, interleaving tasks made the latencies shorter or longer depending on direction, while for middle-age adults, latencies became longer for all directions. our observations can be explained in the context of models such as that of brown et al. (neural netw 17:471-510, 2004), which proposed that different combinations of frontal eye field (fef) layers, interacting with cortico-subcortical areas, control saccade triggering in gap and overlap trials. moreover, we suggest that in early adulthood, the fef is functioning optimally; frequent changes of activity in the fef can be beneficial, leading to shorter latencies, at least for some directions. however, for middle-age adults, frequent changes of activity of a less optimally functioning fef can be time consuming. studying the alternation of gap and overlap tasks provides a fine tool to explore development, aging and disease.</p>\n",

            "publication_abstract": "<p>Op art generates illusory visual motion. it has been proposed that eye movements participate in such illusion. this study examined the effect of eye movement instructions (fixation vs. free exploration) on the sensation of motion as well as the body sway of subjects viewing op art paintings. twenty-eight healthy adults in orthostatic stance were successively exposed to three visual stimuli consisting of one figure representing a cross (baseline condition) and two op art paintings providing sense of motion in depth-bridget riley's movements in squares and akiyoshi kitaoka's rollers. before their exposure to the op art images, participants were instructed either to fixate at the center of the image (fixation condition) or to explore the artwork (free viewing condition). posture was measured for 30 s per condition using a body fixed sensor (accelerometer). the major finding of this study is that the two op art paintings induced a larger antero-posterior body sway both in terms of speed and displacement and an increased motion illusion in the free viewing condition as compared to the fixation condition. for body sway, this effect was significant for the riley painting, while for motion illusion this effect was significant for kitaoka's image. these results are attributed to macro-saccades presumably occurring under free viewing instructions, and most likely to the small vergence drifts during fixations following the saccades; such movements in interaction with visual properties of each image would increase either the illusory motion sensation or the antero-posterior body sway.</p>\n",

            "publication_abstract": "<p>The planning, control and execution of eye movements in 3d space relies on a distributed system of cortical and subcortical brain regions. within this network, the eye fields have been described in animals as cortical regions in which electrical stimulation is able to trigger eye movements and influence their latency or accuracy. this review focuses on the frontal eye field (fef) a \"hub\" region located in humans in the vicinity of the pre-central sulcus and the dorsal-most portion of the superior frontal sulcus. the straightforward localization of the fef through electrical stimulation in animals is difficult to translate to the healthy human brain, particularly with non-invasive neuroimaging techniques. hence, in the first part of this review, we describe attempts made to characterize the anatomical localization of this area in the human brain. the outcome of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri), magneto-encephalography (meg) and particularly, non-invasive mapping methods such a transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) are described and the variability of fef localization across individuals and mapping techniques are discussed. in the second part of this review, we will address the role of the fef. we explore its involvement both in the physiology of fixation, saccade, pursuit, and vergence movements and in associated cognitive processes such as attentional orienting, visual awareness and perceptual modulation. finally in the third part, we review recent evidence suggesting the high level of malleability and plasticity of these regions and associated networks to non-invasive stimulation. the exploratory, diagnostic, and therapeutic interest of such interventions for the modulation and improvement of perception in 3d space are discussed.</p>\n",

            "publication_abstract": "<p>Deterioration of motor and cognitive performance with advancing age is well documented, but its cause remains unknown. animal studies dating back to the late 1970s reveal that age-associated neurocognitive changes are linked to age-dependent changes in synaptic plasticity, including alterations of long-term potentiation and depression (ltp and ltd). non-invasive brain stimulation techniques enable measurement of ltp- and ltd-like mechanisms of plasticity, in vivo, in humans, and may thus provide valuable insights. we examined the effects of a 40-s train of continuous theta-burst stimulation (ctbs) to the motor cortex (600 stimuli, three pulses at 50 hz applied at a frequency of 5 hz) on cortico-spinal excitability as measured by the motor evoked potentials (meps) induced by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation before and after ctbs in the contralateral first dorsal interosseus muscle. thirty-six healthy individuals aged 19-81 years old were studied in two sites (boston, usa and barcelona, spain). the findings did not differ across study sites. we found that advancing age is negatively correlated with the duration of the effect of ctbs (r = -0.367; p = 0.028) and the overall amount of corticomotor suppression induced by ctbs (r = -0.478; p = 0.003), and positively correlated with the maximal suppression of amplitude on motor evoked responses in the target muscle (r = 0.420; p = 0.011). we performed magnetic resonance imaging (mri)-based individual morphometric analysis in a subset of subjects to demonstrate that these findings are not explained by age-related brain atrophy or differences in scalp-to-brain distance that could have affected the tbs effects. our findings provide empirical evidence that the mechanisms of cortical plasticity area are altered with aging and their efficiency decreases across the human lifespan. this may critically contribute to motor and possibly cognitive decline.</p>\n",

            "publication_abstract": "<p>Brain plasticity can be conceptualized as nature's invention to overcome limitations of the genome and adapt to a rapidly changing environment. as such, plasticity is an intrinsic property of the brain across the lifespan. however, mechanisms of plasticity may vary with age. the combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) with electroencephalography (eeg) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) enables clinicians and researchers to directly study local and network cortical plasticity, in humans in vivo, and characterize their changes across the age-span. parallel, translational studies in animals can provide mechanistic insights. here, we argue that, for each individual, the efficiency of neuronal plasticity declines throughout the age-span and may do so more or less prominently depending on variable 'starting-points' and different 'slopes of change' defined by genetic, biological, and environmental factors. furthermore, aberrant, excessive, insufficient, or mistimed plasticity may represent the proximal pathogenic cause of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders such as autism spectrum disorders or alzheimer's disease.</p>\n",

            "publication_abstract": "<p>The concurrent combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) with electroencephalography (tms-eeg) is a powerful technology for characterizing and modulating brain networks across developmental, behavioral, and disease states. given the global initiatives in mapping the human brain, recognition of the utility of this technique is growing across neuroscience disciplines. importantly, tms-eeg offers translational biomarkers that can be applied in health and disease, across the lifespan, and in humans and animals, bridging the gap between animal models and human studies. however, to utilize the full potential of tms-eeg methodology, standardization of tms-eeg study protocols is needed. in this article, we review the principles of tms-eeg methodology, factors impacting tms-eeg outcome measures, and the techniques for preventing and correcting artifacts in tms-eeg data. to promote the standardization of this technique, we provide comprehensive guides for designing tms-eeg studies and conducting tms-eeg experiments. we conclude by reviewing the application of tms-eeg in basic, cognitive and clinical neurosciences, and evaluate the potential of this emerging technology in brain research.</p>\n",
